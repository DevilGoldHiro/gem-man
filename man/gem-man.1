.TH "GEM\-MAN" "1" "March 2010" "DEFUNKT" "RubyGems Manual"
.
.SH "NAME"
\fBgem-man\fR \-\- view a gem's man page
.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.
.nf

\fBgem man <GEM>
gem man <SECTION> <GEM>
gem man --latest <GEM>
gem man --exact <GEM>
gem man --all \fR
.
.fi
.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The \fBgem man\fR command can be used to display a man page for an
installed RubyGem. The man page must be included with the gem \- \fBgem-man\fR does no generation or magic.
.
.P
For an introduction to man pages, see \fBman(1)\fR (or type \fBman man\fR in
your shell).
.
.SH "QUICKSTART"
.
.nf

\fBgem install gem-man
gem man gem-man \fR
.
.fi
.
.P
Metalicious.
.
.SH "GEM"
\fBgem man\fR expects to be passed the name of an installed gem. If there
are multiple man pages found for the gem, you will be asked which
you'd like to view. If only a single man page is found it will be
displayed.
.
.P
Man pages are any files whose extension is a single digit [0\-9],
e.g. \fBron.1\fR.
.
.SH "SECTION"
Specifying a \fBSECTION\fR as the first argument narrows the search to man
pages matching the provided section. For example, if the "mustache"
gem includes \fBman/mustache.1\fR and \fBman/mustache.5\fR the command \fBgem
man 1 mustache\fR will display \fBman/mustache.1\fR without asking if you'd
like to see \fBman/mustache.5\fR.
.
.SH "OPTIONS"
\fBgem man\fR's default mode of operation is to open a man page for a
single gem or, if multiple man pages are found, ask which you'd like
to open. If there are any ambiguities as to which gem to use, \fBgem
man\fR will ask which you'd prefer.
.
.P
You can specify gems or list available gems using a few options.
.
.TP
\fB-l\fR, \fB--latest\fR 
If there are multiple versions of a gem, open the latest.
.
.TP
\fB-v\fR, \fB--version\fR 
Specify version of gem to man.
.
.TP
\fB-e\fR, \fB--exact\fR 
Only list exact matches.
.
.TP
\fB-a\fR, \fB--all\fR 
List all installed gems that have manuals.
.
.P
See \fBgem help man\fR to view the options at any time.
